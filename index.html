            <p>
                The Intern Hub BD program at VTTI gives select Virginia Tech students the opportunity to work alongside
                leading automakers on projects that address the industry's most pressing transportation challenges.
                Under the guidance of a faculty mentor, interns will work on high-tech automotive projects that match
                their current interests and future career aspirations.
            </p>

            <p>
                With internships spanning the traditional academic and summer semesters, Intern Hub BD students will make
                substantial contributions to the future of transportation while developing the real-world skills
                demanded by high-tech employers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Graduates of the program will be equipped with the skill sets and knowledge to become the next generation
                of leaders in the transportation industry and are likely to receive offers of employment from their
                sponsoring Industry Partners.
